Deep Learning

Crop diseases are a major treat to productive sector and food security. In Costa Rica, but also
around the world, farmers suffer the presence of diseases resulting in severe crops yield loss. Diseases
detection is a hard task, usually farmers do not have all the knowledge required to deal with diseases.
In recent years, there has been increased efforts to implement computer vision approaches in this field.
The increased global use of smartphones together with deep learning and machine learning methods
have intended to provide a supplementary mobile assisted plant disease diagnostic. In this research,
we compare convolution neural networks (CNN) by analyzing the public dataset of PlantVillage project.
That data set consist in healthy and diseased plant leaf images. By implementing CNN, we achieved high
accuracy levels of 97.83% for a pre-trained densenet-161 model. We also created a custom model, with
which we achieved an accuracy of 92.06%. We also register the execution time of the learning process
and the size of resulting models. As a result, we note that custom model was significantly faster and
smaller than pre-trained model. We concluded that for the creation of a mobile-based disease detection
solution, it could be better to use a custom CNN instead of use the pre-trained option.
